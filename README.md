**Introduction**

This Movie Ticket Booking System Has Inbuilt File Handling For the User Management and the Tickets.
Also, it has a unique representation of the seating arrangement in the theatre along with the Different price categories in the theatre 
This System is divided into two parts:

**1. Administrator**
This option is for the Admin to edit the movie names, change the movie prices, add the age restriction to the movies, reset all records, and even book a ticket.

**To open the Administrator option:**
**Admin Name: admin**
**Admin Password: admin1234**

The Changes made in the Administrator Home will also reflect in the User Home such as If you book a ticket in the Administrator menu the User Home shows that particular seat was already equipped and vice-versa

Also, If all records and ticket from the Administrator will also reset all records and tickets for the users and the administrator.


**2. User**
This option is for the user for the users where they need to **Sign up** first then **Sign in** with the same credentials to open the user menu **Users can decide their own email and password they are stored in the file to avoid the sign-up process for the next time**

Here User can book the tickets, check the seat availability, and also show the ticket. The tickets are in the format of the **userName.txt**

**Also the user accounts, seating availability, and the tickets booked by the users and the administrator are stored even after you close the program. So even if you open it next time you will get the same experience as last time.**

**If the records and tickets were cleared by clicking the option available in the administrator menu, it will lead to the formatting of all records and all the existing written data will be lost and the system will come to the default state.**

**Go and give it a try!**
