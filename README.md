**Admin Password : admin1234**


The Changes made in the Administrator Home will also reflect in the User Home such as If you book a ticket in the Administrator menu the in User Home shows that particular seat was already equipped and vice- versa

Also If reset all records and ticket from the Administrator will also reset all records and tickets for the users and also for the administrator.

**2. User**
This option is for the user for the users where they need to **Sign up** first then **Sign in** with the same credentials to open the user menu **User can decide there own email and password also they are stored in the file to avoiding the sign up process for the next time**


Here User can book the tickets, check the seat avaliability and also show the ticket. The tickets are in the format of the **userName.txt**
